# build a weather app using 'Weather' class
# use some read-only properties such as city, country code
# description (sunny, rainy, windy, snow)
# temperature in celcius, fahrenheit (c*9/5 + 32) and kelvin (c+273)
# Capitalize city initial and country code
# using @property decorators and __name mangling
# and an overridden __str__ to pretty print, e.g. Local weather for Athlone-IE is sunny at 25.5c
# country can be validated (ie, fr, de, aus, gb, ind, us)
# wind-speed and direction can be added as a dictionary
# weather for city-country can be recorded in files for that city-country
# historical weather info can be retrieved
# class import can be used
